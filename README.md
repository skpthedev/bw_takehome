# Child Care Data ETL Project

This project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service designed to process child care provider data from multiple sources and consolidate it into a single SQLite database.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/child-care-data-etl.git
   cd child-care-data-etl
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### requirements.txt

Here's the content of the `requirements.txt` file:

```
openpyxl==3.0.10
requests==2.26.0
```

## Running the Service

1. Ensure your Excel file is named "Technical Exercise Data.xlsx" and is in the project root directory.

2. Run the ETL script:
   ```
   python etl.py
   ```

3. The script will process the data and create a SQLite database named `child_care_data.db` in the project directory.

## Tradeoffs and Future Improvements

While developing this ETL service, several tradeoffs were made to balance functionality, time constraints, and simplicity:

1. **SQLite Database**: We used SQLite for simplicity, but for a production environment, a more robust database system like PostgreSQL would be more appropriate.

2. **Error Handling**: The current implementation has basic error handling. In a production system, more comprehensive error handling and logging would be crucial.

3. **Data Validation**: We implemented basic data cleaning and validation. More rigorous validation checks could be added to ensure data integrity.

4. **Geocoding**: The current geocoding implementation is basic and may not handle all address formats. A more sophisticated geocoding service could improve accuracy.

5. **Performance**: For large datasets, the current row-by-row processing might be slow. Batch processing or using more efficient data processing libraries like pandas could improve performance.

6. **Testing**: The current version lacks unit tests. Implementing a comprehensive test suite would be a priority for a production-ready system.

Given additional time, these areas would be prime candidates for improvement.

## Long-term ETL Strategies

For a more scalable and robust ETL process in the long term, consider the following strategies:

1. **Schema Flexibility**: Implement a schema-on-read approach to handle varying file formats and changing schemas.

2. **Cloud-based Infrastructure**: Utilize cloud services (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Data Lake) for scalable storage and processing.

3. **Workflow Orchestration**: Use tools like Apache Airflow for scheduling and monitoring ETL jobs.

4. **Data Quality Framework**: Implement automated data quality checks using tools like Great Expectations.

5. **Metadata Management**: Develop a comprehensive metadata management system for better data governance.

6. **Real-time Processing**: Consider implementing stream processing for real-time data ingestion and transformation.

7. **Machine Learning Integration**: Explore opportunities to use ML for data enrichment and anomaly detection.

## Additional Notes

- This project is a prototype and may require additional security measures before deployment in a production environment.
- Regular code reviews and updates to dependencies are recommended to maintain the health and security of the system.
- Consider implementing a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
